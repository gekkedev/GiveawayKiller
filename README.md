# GiveawayKiller
This script can automatically log in and solves/skips tasks on Steam-related giveaway websites. GiveawayKiller is the successor of the [Steam Giveaway Enhancer](https://github.com/gekkedev/giveawayHelperEnhancer). It also removes banners/popups if a giveaway site excessively uses them.
