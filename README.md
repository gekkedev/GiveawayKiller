# GiveawayKiller
This script can automatically log in and solves/skips tasks on Steam-related giveaway websites. GiveawayKiller is the successor of the [Steam Giveaway Enhancer](https://github.com/gekkedev/giveawayHelperEnhancer). It also removes banners/popups if a giveaway site excessively uses them.

**Disclaimer: Any usage of this script may violate the Terms of Service of the sites it runs on. In most cases (especially when a website is violating the T.O.S of Steam) it is absolutely meant to do that. Use it at your own risk.**
